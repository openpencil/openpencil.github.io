# A daily miscellany of *How do I's*.


## Android
- How do I backup all my folders on  my Android phone to Google Drive? </br>
- How do I sync files across devices using the wifi capabilities of the devices themselves? (Not the LAN or the web) </br>

- How do I use a FLAC file as the alarm ringtone in my Android phone? </br>
Use the interface from ES File Explorer File Manager. Quite possibly the best file manager for Android. Get it at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en)</br>
</br>

## GitHub
- How do I set up a blog inside these GitHub personal pages? </br>
</br>

## Google Plus
- *{If the GitHub question is resolved}*  How do I get a github blog to display my G+ content or maybe the latest music stream from last.fm? </br>
